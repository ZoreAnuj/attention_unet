# Attention U-Net

PyTorch implementation of "Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas." by Oktay et al.

The paper is available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03999.pdf

My implementation largely borrows from Hong Jing tutorial on Towards Data Science, 
available at: https://towardsdatascience.com/biomedical-image-segmentation-attention-u-net-29b6f0827405

I will use Drishti-GS retina images dataset.
